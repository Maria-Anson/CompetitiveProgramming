> Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return _the length of the **longest palindrome**_ that can be built with those letters.
> 
> Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** s = "abccccdd"
> **Output:** 7
> **Explanation:** One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
> </pre>
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** s = "a"
> **Output:** 1
> **Explanation:** The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
> </pre>
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> *   `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
> *   `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.
