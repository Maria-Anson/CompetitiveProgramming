> ou are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.
> 
> You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.
> 
> Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> **Output:** 5
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
> Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
> </pre>
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
> **Output:** 0
> **Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
> </pre>
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> *   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
> *   `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

# The pivot is the minimum price in the list.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        pivot = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        # We iterate through the list, and if the current price minus the pivot is greater than the profit, we update the profit.
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] - pivot > profit:
                profit = prices[i] - pivot
            # If the current price is less than the pivot, we update the pivot.
            if prices[i]<pivot:
                pivot = prices[i]
