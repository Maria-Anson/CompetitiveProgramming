> Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **subsequence** of_ `t`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.
> 
> A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
> **Output:** true
> </pre>
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
> **Output:** false
> </pre>
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> *   `0 <= s.length <= 100`
> *   `0 <= t.length <= 104`
> *   `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
> 
> **Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 109`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
