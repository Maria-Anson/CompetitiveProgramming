> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, andÂ **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
> 
> Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** nums = [2,3,2]
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
> </pre>
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
> **Output:** 4
> **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
> Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
> </pre>
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> <pre>**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
> **Output:** 3
> </pre>
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> *   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
> *   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
